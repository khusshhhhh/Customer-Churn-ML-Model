Description: The project revolves around analyzing customers who are churning (i.e., canceling their subscription) from a top e-commerce company's dataset. The goal is to develop a churn prediction model.
Goal: The main objectives are:
To construct a churn prediction model that can accurately predict which customers will leave and which will stay. The organization can then use this information to take preventative measures to retain these customers and reduce the churn rate.
To conduct an in-depth exploratory analysis of the given customer data to understand more about their habits and preferences. This involves looking for patterns and trends in the data. The findings from this analysis can be used to gain a deeper understanding of the company's customer base and guide strategic planning.
