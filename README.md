1. **Data Loading & Preprocessing**:
   - First off, I loaded our dataset into a pandas DataFrame. I'm pretty sure it was a CSV file.
   - I noticed some missing values in the data. To handle this, I filled in missing values in specific columns with their mean or median. For some other columns, I thought it made sense to label the missing values as "Unknown".
   - I converted some of the columns into more suitable data types. For instance, I changed one column to a datetime format to make it more usable.
   - I also binned a few continuous variables, like "HourSpendOnApp", into categories. This helps in understanding patterns in broader ranges rather than exact values.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - I used the `plotly` library to create some visualizations. I felt histograms would help us see the distribution of certain variables, while pie charts could show us the composition of categorical data.
   - I also used a sunburst chart, which is great for visualizing hierarchical data. In our case, I wanted to see the relationship between hours spent on the app and the order count.
   - I made sure to customize the visualizations with meaningful titles, colors, and layouts.
   - While analyzing the charts, I noted down some interesting findings. For instance, I observed that a significant segment of our users, about 67%, who spend more time on the app tend to have an order count of 2.

3. **Data Transformation & Preprocessing for Modeling**:
   - I selected specific columns from our DataFrame that I believed would be valuable features for our model.
   - Since machine learning models work best with numerical data, I one-hot encoded our categorical variables.
   - I also scaled our features using the `StandardScaler`. This ensures that all features have the same influence on the model, especially important for certain algorithms.

4. **Modeling**:
   - I decided to train several machine learning models to see which one performs the best. I experimented with Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, XGBoost, and AdaBoost.
   - For each model, I trained it using our training data, made predictions on our test data, and then evaluated its performance.

5. **Evaluation**:
   - I used various metrics to evaluate each model's performance. I looked at accuracy to see the overall correctness of our model.
   - I also used ROC AUC, which tells us about the model's capability to differentiate between our classes.
   - To get a more detailed view, I plotted a confusion matrix and generated a classification report. This gave insights into true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives.
   - Lastly, I visualized the ROC curve to see the true positive rate against the false positive rate for different thresholds.

And that's a summary of what I did with the code. Let me know if you'd like to dive deeper into any specific parts or if you have any questions!
